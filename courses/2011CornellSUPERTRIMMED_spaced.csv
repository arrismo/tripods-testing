898,2011CornellSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,NBA 5130 International Finance Cases ,"Spring. 1.5 credits. W. Bailey. International finance is different because of two issues: exchange-rate volatility and barriers to the flow of capital. Furthermore, political risk is heightened when money crosses borders, and governance, disclosure, law, and regulation are more varied than in a single-country context. The purpose of this course is to practice applying the ideas and methods of finance to cross-border problems. The course is centered on six cases including discussions of related research and other materials. "

903,2011CornellSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,NBA 5450 The Search for Alpha ,"Fall. 1 credit. R. Marin. This course will focus on the fundamental trends under way in the asset management industry. While it will start with an overview of the investment management industry, it will move quickly toward a review of the more recent growth in hedge funds. Given the attention that the investment management industry (not to mention the world at large) has put on hedge funds and the relatively unregulated and secretive nature of the breed, the course will seek to answer the question of what exactly is going on in the industry and where it is going. The intention will be to give students an overview of the hedge fund space from the perspective of what comprises it, who the participants are (managers, investors, support areas, and intermediaries), how hedge funds are assessed and measured both individually and in portfolio, how investors access hedge funds, and what major issues face the industry. "
904,2011CornellSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,NBA 5460 Liability Driven Alpha ,"Spring. 1 credit. R. Marin. This course will focus on the fundamental trends underway in the pension management industry. This $3 trillion arena has, from before the creation of ERISA to the present day, been managed in a very homogenous manner with similar investment approaches and very questionable results. The convergence of accounting, regulatory, and market forces is forcing change upon the industry in a way that will impact a broad range of service providers and potential investors, and indeed the underlying company plan sponsors and the very participants they serve. These changes will produce major dislocations and opportunities for asset managers, investment bankers, insurance companies, private equity firms, hedge funds, and a whole array of processing companies. Given the demographics of the aging baby-boomer population and the looming crisis in global retirement funding, this may prove to be a bellwether issue in finance and social policy for the next decade. The changing regulatory and accounting rules that govern defined benefit plans will be reviewed with emphasis on the Pension Protection Act of 2006, FAS 158 (Phases I and II) and the convergence of U.S. and international accounting standards in this arena.

905,2011CornellSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,NBA 5470 Operational Alpha ,"Spring. 1 credit. R. Marin. This course will focus on the elements of the asset management industry that most critically add to success, but that are outside the traditional realm of investment strategy. It is generally understood today that risk is comprised of many elements and includes a significant component of operational risk. There are operational elements of the investment process that clearly add or detract significant value from returns just like operational risk can add to or detract from overall risk. These operational elements that add to return can be called operational alpha and the more mature a market or investment strategy becomes, or the more difficult the return environment, the more important operational alpha becomes.

906,2011CornellSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,NBA 5510 Emerging Markets Finance ,"Spring. 1.5 credits. G. Karolyi. This course explores financial decision making that is special to emerging economies. These countries constitute the engine-of-growth opportunities in the world economy, but their markets are also prone to crises, a feature that reinforces the importance of measuring risk.

"
907,2011CornellSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,NBA 5980 Behavioral Finance ,"Fall. 1.5 credits. M. Huang. Traditional finance theories assume that financial market participants are rational, and argue that the financial market is always efficient.

This course introduces the conceptual framework of behavioral finance and then applies the framework to study a wide range of issues in "
908,2011CornellSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,NBA 6560 Valuations Principles ,"Fall, spring. 1.5 credits. Staff. This course is about valuation—the valuation of stocks, companies, parts of companies, and real assets. Three methods of valuation are introduced: intrinsic valuation, relative valuation by multiples using comparable s, and contingent claims valuation, based on a real options approach. The rest of the course will be dedicated to understanding each of these methods in greater detail and more importantly, applying them to the valuation of actual companies. This will involve understanding in detail discounted cash-flow models and the many inputs required to build them; dividend discount models; the determination and use of relative-value multiples such as price/earnings and price/ book value; and finally, how to apply option theory to specific problems in valuation. The course includes a special session on valuation approaches and challenges specific to venture capital and private-equity investing. This will include a discussion of topics such as required internal rates of return (IRRs), the effects of leverage on valuation, and issues relating to the valuation of high-growth startups. "

The course addresses the managerial issues in the political, legal, and social environment of business. Most strategy courses focus on interactions with customers, competitors, suppliers, workers, or financial institutions that occur in market contexts. However, many strategic interactions occur outside of the marketplace.

935,2011CornellSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,NBA 5880 Critical Thinking for Business Leaders ,"Spring. 1.5 credits. R. Mish. This course is based on the proposition that leading well requires thinking well—that is, in order to succeed in any business leadership role, one must learn, exhibit, and model critical thinking skills to organizational stakeholders: colleagues, supervisors/senior executives, and clients/customers. The first few class sessions look at a series of brief articles that attempt to advance arguments in favor of a particular business proposition, and students learn how to examine these arguments critically, including by evaluating the strength and limitations of the evidence presented and by identifying and articulating the best counter-arguments to the positions offered. The remainder of the course is spent applying these critical thinking skills to a set of business cases, using a Strategic Thinking Problem-Solving framework. By the end of the course, the goal is for students to be able to approach business problems in a systematic and critically thoughtful way, and to produce and communicate a problem solution that is well reasoned, well received by ultimate decision makers, and likely to be implemented with success by a group/organization that a student is leading.

938,2011CornellSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,NBA 6660 Negotiations ,"Fall, spring. 3 credits. Staff. Judgment is the art and science of transforming perception into thought or opinion. Negotiation is the art and science of securing agreements between two or more interdependent parties. The purpose of this course is to understand the theory and processes of negotiation as it is practiced in a variety of settings. It is designed to complement the technical and diagnostic skills learned in other courses. A basic premise is that while a manager needs analytical skills to develop optimal solutions to problems, he or she also needs a broad array of negotiation skills for these solutions to be accepted and implemented. The course highlights the components of an effective negotiation and teaches students to analyze their own behavior in negotiations. It is largely experiential, giving students an opportunity to develop their skills by participating in negotiations and integrating their experiences with the principles presented in the assigned readings and course discussions.

This course explores the complex process of “becoming a leader” by systematically uncovering beliefs and myths about leadership and rigorously examining how they hold up to the scrutiny of critical thinking, analysis, and research. Each class will address a number of important questions about leadership. Generally, the class uses case studies and videos to first illustrate a topic by focusing on a specific leader and decision or dilemma faced by that leader, then abstract from the specific to the general by discussing the principles and research findings pertaining to that aspect of leadership. Students should also develop a significantly enhanced understanding of their own leadership strengths and objectives because the course requires personalization of concepts via a number of self-reflections and exercises.

The Middle Passage is perhaps the most evocative and simultaneously the most painful of transitions any people have made. Whereas for many the passage to the Americas was loaded with expectation of freedom, for Africans the passage across the Atlantic was loaded with pain, loss, and separation. The Middle Passage (referred to as the Maafa) then becomes a journey of separation, dismemberment, and dislocation. But it was also on the Middle Passage, for those who survived, that the transformation into African Diaspora peoples began. This course examines a range of middle passage texts such as novels, poetry, film, drama, slave narratives, and historical texts in order to explore comparatively how artists from across the African Diaspora have approached this historically and emotionally loaded event.

This course will consider these and other approaches to sport, encouraging students to bring their own involvements in sport to reflect not only upon sport itself, but also upon how such reflection can illuminate cultural, psychological, and political dimensions of social life. Why, for example, do we take sport (and other forms of recreation) so seriously? Why do many of us apparently invest more passion in such pursuits than to life’s allegedly more serious activities? How is sport integrated into people’s identities?

The issues addressed in this section carry over into the next, colonialism and post-colonialism, in which post structuralist readings of history are counter posed to Marxist ones.

This course covers a wide range of Greek literary and philosophical works as well as modern critical and philosophical writings on the Greeks. The focus throughout is on the status of language, the many forms of discourse that appear in the literature, and the attempts the Greeks themselves made to overcome the perceived inadequacies and difficulties inherent in language as the medium of poetry and philosophy. The course inquires into the development of philosophy in the context of a culture infused with traditional, mythological accounts of the cosmos. It asks how poetic forms such as tragedy responded to and made an accommodation with philosophical discourse while creating an intense emotional effect on the audience; how the first historians, using literary and philosophical discourse, created space for their own inquiry; and discusses how these issues persist and are formulated in our own thinking.

Late Medieval literature in vernacular Greek established the possibility of high-quality writing outside the learned canon. Subsequent production proved that secular creativity could cater for the needs of new audiences, like women and a semi-literate public, for whom it created a space. It evolved a conceptual vocabulary that anticipated the important achievements of the Renaissance. This literature was an integral constituent of European tradition. It also interacted in powerful ways with Near Eastern letters.

An historical study of children’s literature from the 17th century to the present, principally in Europe and America, which will explore changing literary forms in relation to the social history of childhood.

Yet think about this: we all carry bits of poetry around with us, in the form of song lyrics. In this class we’ll explore the meeting ground of these two major art forms, considering both similarities and differences between printed poems and lyrics.

A “utopia” is an imaginary world, a fantastical “no-place” that conveys important truths about the real world. This course surveys the literary genre of utopia from the Renaissance to today, focusing on writers who invent new worlds through fiction. In Thomas More’s Utopia, we explore utopia’s emergence in the 16th century in response to European political upheaval and New World exploration, then turn to how British and American writers transform utopian visions in the following centuries. Finally, we consider how utopia is reworked in science fiction’s paradoxical emphasis on both fantasy and realism. Topics include the politics of gender, technology in a perfect society, and the wildly inventive forms of utopian fiction by Shakespeare, Margaret Cavendish, Jonathan Swift, Aldous Huxley, Ursula LeGuin, and Philip K.

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a student who has read Jane Austen must be in want of excuses to continue that delicious experience. This course explores Austen’s characters, culture, and narrative art against the backdrop of films, novels, and poems that resonate with her fiction. We will investigate Austen’s alluring mystique, her importance in literary history, and her continuing attraction in the 21st century.

Critical study of major works by Hardy, Conrad, Forster, Lawrence, Joyce, Woolf, Eliot, Yeats, Wilde, Pound, and others. While the emphasis will be on close reading of individual texts, we shall place the authors and works within the context of literary, political, cultural, and intellectual history. The course will seek to define the development of literary modernism (mostly but not exclusively in England), and relate literary modernism in England to that in Europe and America as well as to other intellectual developments. We shall be especially interested in the relationship between modern literature and modern painting and sculpture; on occasion, we shall look at slides. Within the course material, students will be able to select the topics on which they write essays. "

In our readings over the semester (which will include some of the 20th century’s greatest literary texts), we will cover the development of Irish writing from the Yeats-led Irish Revival of the century’s early years through Joyce’s high modernist virtuosity to the proto-postmodernism s of O’Brien and Beckett. Along the way we will also examine how Irish modernism raises fundamental questions about such things as the relation between language and national identity; the nature of modernism’s “newness”; colonial, postcolonial, and “semi colonial” culture; the political uses of literature; and the contending forces of cosmopolitanism and nationalism in the modern period.

How do Southern writers help us to understand sectional division and regional identity? Proposing that Southern history and culture embody fundamental social contradictions—about race, but also about gender and class—this course will consider black and white, male and female Southern writers from the Civil War to the pre-Civil Rights era and beyond.

Jane Austen and zombies, A Christmas Carol in 3D, an orgy of PBS miniseries: why is the 19th century so un-dead? The plot of the British novel—sexual betrayal, path o logical greed and revenge, the sadistic damage wrought on helpless children—reflects wrenching social and technological transformations whose global sweep rivals that of our own era’s conflicts. Intertwining domestic and imperial spaces, realistic fiction embodied the most innovative attempt to grasp and contain such seismic shifts in an entertaining idiom for a rising mass readership. These works refract the cultural anxieties of the age and suggest sources of redemption. We can take pleasure in them even as we critically analyze how the Victorians live now. Likely authors include Austen, Dickens, Brontë, Eliot, Hardy, Conrad. "

We shall place Ulysses in the context of Joyce’s canon, Irish culture, and literary modernism. We shall explore the relationship between Ulysses and other experiments in modernism— especially painting and sculpture—and show how Ulysses redefines the concepts of epic, hero, and reader. We shall examine Ulysses as a political novel—specifically, Joyce’s response to Yeats and the Celtic Renaissance; Joyce’s role in the debate about the direction of Irish politics after Parnell; and Joyce’s response to British colonial occupation of Ireland. We shall also consider Ulysses as an urban novel in which Bloom, the marginalized Jew and outsider, is symptomatic of the kind of alienation created by urban culture. No previous experience with Joyce is required. [ENGL 3711 American Poetry to 1950 (also AMST 3711) (LA-AS) Fall. 4 credits. Next offered 2011–2012. "

However, there will be many craft lessons discussing narrative techniques, especially those used in film. We will watch a clip and break the scene down to figure out how a director is manipulating the narrative to tell a story. Then we will see the same manipulation being pulled off, only this time within a different medium, on paper. Good storytelling is good storytelling, and the same narrative techniques or, better said, tricks that are used in film can be applied to our fiction. "
1395,2011CornellSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,ENGL 3762 Law and Literature: The Jury as Audience ,"Fall. 4 credits. B. Meyler. The jury is purportedly “the bulwark of democracy,” but it has also been seen as the most potentially destabilizing component of the Anglo-American legal system. Literature, drama, and TV crime shows have helped to form these competing views of the jury. How and why have plays compared jurors with spectators? How were 19th-century trial reports like and unlike novels, and how did jurors read both? Has the alleged “CSI effect” really made contemporary American juries demand more forensic evidence? This course will explore these and related questions in historical and legal context. Works studied may include Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus, Daniel Defoe’s Moll Flanders, Wilkie Collins’s The Law and the Lady, Susan Gla spell’s “A Jury of Her Peers,” Anna Deavere Smith’s Twilight: Los Angeles, and CSI.

How does the modernism of the 1920s and ’30s differ from the experimentation s that shaped the 1960s and ’70s? How are artists influenced by social movements? How does art influence the very direction of social movements? This course will compare the 1920s and ’30s Harlem Renaissance and the 1960s and ’70s Black Arts movement. Both social movements produce a stunning interplay of words, images, music, dance, assimilation, and resistance. The selected artists may include Josephine Baker, Nella Larsen, Langston Hughes, Sun Ra, James Brown, Amiri Baraka, Gil Scott-Heron, Nikki Giovanni, Romare Bearden, and the A fri Cobra collective. "
1397,2011CornellSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,ENGL 4020 Literature as Moral Inquiry (KCM-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. S. Mohanty. What can literary works, especially novels, tell us about moral issues? Should they be seen as suggesting a form of moral inquiry similar to the kind of philosophical discussion we get in, say, Aristotle’s Nico mac he an Ethics? Can reading philosophical works in ethics together with novels that deal with similar themes help us understand these themes better? This course is an attempt to answer these questions. We will read selections from Aristotle, Kant, Marx, and Nietzsche, and use these works to help us understand the nature of moral inquiry in novels like Eliot’s Middle march, Coetzee’s Disgrace, Morrison’s Beloved, Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway, Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, and Achebe’s Things Fall Apart. Other writers we will most probably read include Nadine Gordimer, Doris Lessing, and Kazuo Ishiguro. [ENGL 4030 Studies in American Poetry: A. R.

Mann. “I trust nothing but on the faith of my eyes”: Francis Bacon’s declaration became a central tenet of philosophical inquiry during the 17th century, as gentlemen and artisans began to collect specimens, dissect bodies, and survey the physical universe. This course explores how the new experimental “science” reverberated in imaginative productions in the age of Shakespeare and Milton. How did poetry and fiction find room for the growing domain of “fact”? Why did Englishmen focus this new scientific gaze on “curiosities” such as the human cadaver, the hermaphrodite, and the New World Indian? In surveying the major developments in English scientific thought before the Enlightenment, the interdisciplinary readings in this course will also introduce students to important literary and philosophical texts from the Renaissance.

1401,2011CornellSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,ENGL 4660 James on Film (LA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. D. Fried. Henry James’s psychologically probing tales of betrayal, delusion, and tragically misdirected freedom pose a powerful challenge for screen adaptation. Analysis of selected films based on James’s novels involves close reading of these extraordinary texts as well as examination of screenplay form, verbal and visual styles of narrative, and larger questions of the expectations of moviegoers and readers. Study of James’s aspirations as a dramatist, his writings on theater, photography, painting, and fiction, and controversies about the interpretation of the novels contribute to understanding how James’s stories have been retold by filmmakers. Novels/films may include Daisy Miller, Washington Square/The Heiress, The Bostonians, The Turn of the Screw/The Innocents, and The Portrait of a Lady or The Wings of the Dove. "

Shakespeare: The Greek and Roman Plays. B. Correll. May be used as one of the three pre-1800 courses required of English majors. Some of Shakespeare’s most engaging dramas are about classical characters: Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, Coriolanus. In his Greek and Roman plays, Shakespeare brings classical heritage to his Renaissance audience; he also actively adapts it in provocative and innovative ways. These plays, from classical sources, come with big questions. Why do so many of Shakespeare’s characters both represent classical authority and place themselves in conflict with it? How do Shakespeare’s adaptive practices compare with other Renaissance playwrights? What is the relationship between these historical plays and their early modern settings? What do they contribute to issues of gender, sexuality, subject formation? We will read ten texts in the seminar and also include some film to see how contemporary filmmakers adapt Shakespeare’s adaptations. Sem. 102. 20th-Century Women Writers of Color. S. Wong (also AAS 4910, FGSS 4912) In this course, we’ll be reading literature— primarily novels—produced by hemispheric American women writers of the mid- to late 20th century. We will look at how these writings articulate concerns with language, home, mobility, and memory, and at how the work is informed by the specific i ties of gender, race, region, and class. Readings may include work by Leslie Marmon Silko, Sandra C is nero s, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Jamaica Kincaid, Gwendolyn Brooks, Ann Petry, Fae Myenne Ng, Car olivia Herron, Helena Maria Viramontes, and Shani Mootoo.

Authentic Romantics. C. Chase. Who are the “authentic” Romantics? Looking for an authentic voice when we read dates back to the Romantic period. In this seminar we will examine how the idea of authenticity appears in works by William Wordsworth, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, and a “pre-Romantic,” Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Rousseau’s Confessions subordinate the concept of truth versus falsehood to the concept of truth as authenticity. Wordsworth’s autobiographical poem, The Prelude, aims at authentically representing “the growth of a poet’s mind.” Shelley and Keats pursue other conceptions of an authentic language. We will look closely at how these texts raise questions about the self and language. Three papers, developing skills necessary for writing an Honors thesis. Sem 2. American Paranoia. K. Attell. Following the lead of Richard Hofstadter’s classic 1964 essay “The Paranoid Style in American Politics,” this course will examine the “paranoid style” in contemporary American fiction and film. The paranoia s and plots we will encounter vary considerably (personal paranoia s, political conspiracies, governments turned enemy, surveillance technology run amok, apocalyptic-millennial paranoia. Yet when viewed together they seem to cohere as a distinct style within post-WWII American narrative. We will ask how paranoid style responds to the contemporary American context and how the fears dominating these narratives shape their aesthetic form. Why has paranoia arisen as such a distinctively American attitude? What is the paranoid afraid of? (Should we be paranoid, too?) Novels by Nabokov, Pynchon, Reed, Dick, DeLillo, Didion, Roth; films by Coppola, Romero, Bigelow, Baldwin. "

Does not count toward major or minor. If you ever have thought that people of great achievement and ingenuity—such as great statesmen, artists, heroes, scientists—also exhibit a touch of madness, well, then you are not alone! Philosophers and poets for a few thousand years have contemplated the close kinship between madness and genius and have engaged in lively discussions about changing definitions of creativity as either ingenuity, inspiration, or insanity; as stemming from divine possession, originality, or fanatic enthusiasm. By reading philosophical and medical treatises, by examining texts of fiction and lyric poetry, as well as by including historical accounts, this course will find out when and why our culture decided to call a madman a genius and a genius mad. We shall trace the history of social and artistic transgression and analyze when and why a culture considers great talent as “too different,” as “path o logical,” or as “un-normal.” You shall read texts ranging from Antiquity to the 18th and 20th centuries and encounter authors from Germany, France, Britain, and the United States. Guest lecturers from various Humanities departments will expand our view on genius as either a human condition, an artistic invention or the delusive state of “madness.” "

This course surveys leading theories of the causes of interstate war—that is, large-scale organized violence between the armed forces of states. Why is war a recurring feature of international politics? Are democracies more peaceful than other types of states, and if so what explains this “democratic peace”? Why do democratic publics seem to reward threats to use force by “rallying around the flag” in support of their governments? Does the inexorable pattern of the rise and fall of nations lead to cycles of great power wars throughout history? These and other questions will be examined in our survey of theories of war at three levels of analysis: the individual and small groups, domestic politics, and the international system.

1433,2011CornellSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,GOVT 6171 Politics of Public Policy ,"Spring. 4 credits. S. Mettler. Much of the literature that comprises the field of policy analysis is characterized by antipathy to politics: scholars attempt to excise political battles and concerns from their studies in order to advance a “rational” portrayal of how policies do or should function. Yet, public policies are, themselves, inherently political. They are defined through political processes, designed and implemented in the context of political institutions, and they in turn shape the character of politics and public life. This course entails the examination and evaluation of a variety of approaches to policy analysis, all of which are united by their inclination to take politics seriously. Readings have been included that comprise variations of rational choice, institutionalist, historical, behavioral, and interpret iv is t analyses. The first part of the course examines different models of the policy process that may inform policy analysis. The second part of the course investigates policy making processes and institutions and examines stages of the policy process, including public mobilization, policy definition, agenda setting, and policy design and implementation. Special attention is given to the American system, focusing on policy making institutions, processes and outcomes in that context, but students who focus on other nations or international system may also find the course useful.

1452,2011CornellSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,HIST 2431 Postcolonial Memories and Politics of History @ (HA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. K. Hirano. Postcolonial studies, which seek to uncover and (re-)articulate repressed voices, memories, and experiences of colonized peoples around the world, have altered the way we understand history. They have brought about the recognition that the historical profession and its mode of knowledge production have been deeply complicit with colonial strategies of domination and violence. This new recognition challenges the normative understanding of history as a discipline devoted to the objective reconstruction of the past enabled by scrupulous efforts to gather data and facts. If historical knowledge is not as “objective” as assumed, it follows that “date” and “facts” are not free from values and subjective judgment. Nor can history reveal the truth about the past. Rather, data/facts themselves constitute a certain type of narrative (that is, they are always already value-ridden) and authors of history select facts and data according to their judgments and criteria in order to explain the causes, effects, processes, and consequences of events they study. In this seminar, by paying attention to this epistemological predicament of history, we will examine the relationship between history and colonialism, and try to imagine a critical and self-reflective mode of historical inquiry based on the insights of Postcolonial Studies.
