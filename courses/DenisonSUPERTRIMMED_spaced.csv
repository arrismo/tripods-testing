0,DenisonSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,"ANSO 100 - People, Culture and Society (4 Credit Hours)","An examination of fundamental questions concerning the nature and foundations of socio cultural behavior. The course presents a variety of socio cultural approaches for understanding human nature and hominid evolution, cross-cultural similarities and differences, the sources of inequality, and the enormity of recent social change. This course is required of all majors and minors in Anthropology/Sociology."
1,DenisonSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,ANSO 210 - Sex and Gender in Society (4 Credit Hours),"This course compares and evaluates a variety of theories which attempt to explain the origins, persistence and effects of gender in American society. In particular, it explores a number of settings that may include:the family, the work place, the political arena, religious activity, violence against women, and face-to-face interaction al contexts. Special attention is given to the ways in which race, ethnicity, class and sexual orientation shape gender experiences. Although its primary focus is American society, the course compares problems of sexual inequality in American society with other, quite different, societies in order to gain a comparative understanding of how discrimination, prejudice, and structural inequality,wherever they are found, create special problems for women. Throughout,the focus is on learning to use structural, historical, and theoretical information as guides to understanding social change and the choices facing women and men."
2,DenisonSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,ANSO 212 - Race and Ethnicity (4 Credit Hours),"Contrary to the expectations of many modern social theorists, race and ethnicity continue to be important elements in the lives of contemporary people, serving as frameworks through which individual identities,community actions, and cultural meanings are interpreted. This course will introduce students to the socio cultural analysis of racial and ethnic identities. How did ethnic and racial identities and communities develop over time? Why does race, though now understood to be a social rather than a biological category, continue to be (mis)understood as a biological category? How do aspects of political, class, gender, and sexual identities influence racial and ethnic identities? We will use a global perspective to understand the conception of race and ethnicity. We will explore these topics among others including cultural and historical variability of ethnic and racial categories, the dialectical formation of identity, and the persistence of certain forms of racial and ethnic prejudice. Students willbe expected to examine critically their own common assumptions and presuppositions about race and ethnicity, and to begin developing the theoretical tools for interpreting life in an ethnically diverse world."
3,DenisonSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,ANSO 217 - Religion and Society (4 Credit Hours),"This course investigates the relationship between religion and society,and the social dimension of religious truth-claims.

How havetradition and change fueled competing visions of Japan what itmeans to be Japanese? How does one go about reconciling these conflicting views? How have these debates evolved over time? How have variously situated individuals and groups in society negotiated shifting circumstances? These questions will be at the heart of this seminar aswe consider case studies from different segments of Japanese society.A range of material will be treated as texts for analysis and discussion including anime, manga, literary works, and ﬁlms as well as ethnographic scholarship on Japanese society."
5,DenisonSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,ANSO 224 - Human Origins and Prehistory (4 Credit Hours),"This course begins with a review of biological anthropology’s view of humanity.

233,DenisonSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,COMM 140 - The Politics of Popular Culture (4 Credit Hours),The terrain of popular culture has historically been a site of contentious struggles and debates. For long (as is the case even today) one’s cultural“taste” was a signiﬁcant factor in determining one’s standing in the social hierarchy. Debates about “high” vs “low” culture and about what cultural texts and practices must stand in to represent a community have involved some of the most well known intellectuals in history.Analyzing the trajectory of these debates over the years provides us witha lens through which to understand historical social changes. It also allows us to appreciate that several contemporary debates (for instance about the cultural meaning of Hip Hop or Reality TV) have historical precedents that inform and precede them. This introductory course seeksto trace those debates from their origins in middle century Europe totheir culmination into contemporary battles over popular culture. In sodoing it seeks to politicize popular culture and unravel the competing ideologies and worldviews embedded within it. We begin by reading someof the prominent theorists of “high” culture and then problem at ize their arguments by studying the challenges to them (most stridently posedby the Birmingham school of scholars). We will then use this historical debate to inform our understanding of the contemporary world of popular culture in America. In the process we will also learn various ways to analyze and critique objects of popular culture around us that we often unthinkingly consume.

416,DenisonSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,ECON 417 - The Eurozone: Optimal Currency Area or Incomplete Monetary Union? (4 Credit Hours),"Before 2010, the Eurozone was hailed as the ﬁrst successful multi-national, large-scale model of monetary and currency union. Several countries in many regions of the world (such as South America, the Middle East, West Africa) have been considering following in the stepsof the European Union (EU) by creating similar currency areas in thenear future. However, the ﬁnancial crisis of the late 2000s followed bythe sovereign debt crisis of the 2010s have challenged the perception ofthe Eurozone has a fully functioning currency area. In this class we will seek to place the creation of the Eurozone in the context of the broader evolution of the EU as a cosmopolitan project. We will examine the socio-economic theories and political ideologies behind the creation of the Eurozone. This will require an understanding of the macroeconomic models which underlie the concept of ‘optimal currency area’ and an investigation of the degree to which the Eurozone is a fully completed project. In particular the solutions provided by EU leaders and institutions to the economic crisis in Greece (and other countries in the Eurozone)will give us a chance to reflect upon the future of the Eurozone and to discuss the intellectual and practical implications of two alternatives that member-states may face as they look towards the future of the EU: 1. the pursuit of further EU integration through the creation of a supranationalﬁscal and political union or 2. the beginning of a process of political and economic devolution towards smaller scale European projects."

This class seeksto align that reality with another: we are an intensely visual species. A critical part of our existence that we experience through all of our senses is one we fail to comprehend through our primary sense. And we have this occasion to use sight in a formalized way – photography – to tellnew stories, and to bring an artistic sensibility to our understanding offood, and perhaps ourselves. Through imagery, writing, and the curator i al process of exhibiting our work in a public setting, we have a truly unique opportunity.

846,DenisonSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,PHIL 298 - Existentialism (4 Credit Hours),"Existentialism asks how we can generate a meaning for our lives without appealing to outside sources. Many existentialists embrace a view characterized with the slogan “existence precedes essence.” This slogan means that any attempt to ﬁgure out what one is must begin with thefact that one is. In addition, if existence precedes essence, then there may well be a multiplicity of ways that one can be, making choosing between these ways a difﬁcult task. That one’s existence may well be experienced as constrained by social forces seemingly beyond one’s control complicates matters. We will read from a variety of sources,including philosophical sources such as Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Sartre,de Beauvoir, or Judith Butler as well as literary or biographical sources,e.g., Beckett, James Baldwin, Frantz Fanon, and others.Prerequisite(s): One previous course in Philosophy, or consent."

What should we value? and What type of person should we be? But, it seems right that we can evaluate our answers to these questions and decide among them only if we correctly answer another set of questions ﬁrst. For instance, how can we know what we should value unless we understand what values are, whether they exist and whether we can know them if they do? How can we know how we oughtto act if we do not know what it means for an act to be morally goodor why we are even obligated to do what is morally good in the ﬁrst place? This course pursues answers to this other set of questions. It inquires into the nature of ethical statements, properties, judgments and attitudes.

Gender gaps in opinion, the double-bound treatment of public ofﬁcials, the exercise of power, political opportunities, and imbalances inrole models, not to mention differences in socialization and psychology all shape what amounts to the political “gender system.” In this course,we will dig into how political power is sought and utilized through a gendered lens that lays bare essential questions of equality in developed societies. To gain an appreciation for equal representation and our role in achieving it, we need to understand the nature of bias and the individual,social, and institutional forces that contribute to and help alleviate that bias. Students will conduct a range of original empirical research to contribute to these important debates."

906,DenisonSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,POSC 326 - Radical Right Parties and Politics in Europe (4 Credit Hours),"What accounts for the emergence, persistence and demise of radical orfar right political parties in Europe? After a period of post-war stability,European party systems began to break down in the 1960s. This led to several new developments, namely, a decline in democratic participation;a decline in the traditional parties of the center Left and center Right; andthe emergence of new parties on both the Left and the Right. This course focuses on the newer parties on the Right that emerged in Western Europe during the 1980's and 1990's. Speciﬁcally we focus on what many scholars label the far or radical right. These parties tend to be organized around a particular set of ideological concepts emphasizing nationalism, exclusion of foreigners, a strong state, welfare chauvinism and, more recently, Islamophobia. Over the course of the semester students will compare and contrast the emergence of these parties and their politics across Europe and discern the differences between what scholars describe as populist radical or populist far right parties from other parties on the extreme right, namely neo fascist or neo-Nazis parties which are viewed as inherently undemocratic and often elitist."

915,DenisonSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,POSC 348 - Foreign and Security Policy in Western Europe (4 Credit Hours),"This course aims to compare key post Cold War foreign policy behaviors during crisis situations concerning the three big states in Western Europe: France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (also referred to asthe EU3, as they all are members of the European Union (EU). Why is itthat we know so little about the foreign policies of three countries which have been the most important allies for the US in the past ﬁfty years?Are these countries middle powers or big powers? What role do they play in the international hierarchy? What others states in Western Europe also conduct foreign policies, they frequently do so as part of the EU,or at least tailor their policies so that they do not substantially deviate from the EU. They also tend to have more of a regional focus as they lackthe means and influence to project their power beyond the conﬁnes of Europe. Thus, the three big can be put in a special category because oftheir status, wealth, influence and power. To explore their behaviors weﬁrst establish conceptual framework for a comparative study of foreign policy (comparative foreign policy analysis). This framework guides our analysis in subsequent empirical cases examining decision-making processes, the domestic and international environment, and foreign policy outputs. We will assess key variables at the individual, group, state and systemic levels of analysis and develop a framework for comparing the foreign policy incentives of these three powers. Speciﬁc areas of inquiry include cognitive and psychological theories of decision-making,group dynamics, organizational interests, public opinion, national role conception, strategic interaction and relative power/capability changes inthe international system."

We will investigate various deﬁnitions of terrorism. Most scholars think that terrorism is not a random act of violence. They see terrorism as planned and, for those who use it, rational. However, there is still a lotof disagreement on what terrorism is, what motivates terrorists, how itcan be fought, and on what we mean by rational and planned. We will compare the various deﬁnitions and perspectives to determine which might work best for our understanding of the phenomena. In addition, wewill focus on some key concepts in the discipline of political science andhow they relate to terrorism, for example: power, ethnicity, religion, andthe media."
