The emergence of Black Power in the US, Brazil and the Caribbean, the consolidation of liberation struggles in Portuguese Africa and the rise of a Black Consciousness trend in Apartheid South Africa all represent key moments. What led young activists to embrace “Black Power?” What led to the emergence of Marxist movements in Portuguese Africa? What events in the Caribbean gave ascendancy to radical tendencies? And what forces contributed to the decline of these movements? This course seeks to answer these questions."
4,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,AFRI 0980.

Global Macho: Race, Gender, and Action Movies.","Carefully sifting through an oft-overlooked but globally popular genre - the muscle-bound action - this class asks: what sort of racial work does an action movie do? What is the role of women in this genre? How should we scrutinize these supposedly empty trifles of the global popular?

84,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,ANTH 1125. Indigenous Arch a eo logie s.,"This is an intro. to Indigenous archaeology, sometimes defined as archaeology by, for and with Indigenous peoples. These approaches combine the study of the past with contemporary social justice concerns.However, they are more than this. In addition to seeking to make archaeology more inclusive of and responsible to Indigenous peoples,they seek to contribute a more accurate understanding of archaeological record. They thus do not reject science, but attempt to broaden it through a consideration of Indigenous epi stem o logie s. This course covers topics as the history of anthropological archaeology, Indigenous knowledge and science, decolonizing methodologies, representation al practices and NAG PRA."

346,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,CLAS 0010. The Greeks.,"From poetry to philosophy, from music to economics to political theory, itis hard to find a subject of study that did not originate with the Greeks, atleast in word. Biology? Greek. Physics? Still Greek. Math? Technology?Gym? You guessed it. Since we cannot escape the Greeks, in this classwe will be on the lookout for them, reading the first classics of Western literature and discussing the great ideas behind them. All texts read in English."
347,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,CLAS 0210B. Death in Ancient Greece.,"Examines how ancient Greeks understood, described, and experienced death. Making use of sources in translation, considers how death is anticipated, imagined, feared, and sometimes sought. Also contrasts classical ideas with current experiences in our own society in order tosee whether and how our assumptions concerning death are culturally determined. Enrollment limited to 19 first year students."
348,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,CLAS 0210T. Travelers in Greece: from Pausanias to Shirley Valentine.,"Ever since Pausanias the Per ie get e wrote his Description of Greecein the 2nd century CE, travelers have been inspired both to see the sights of Greece and to narrate their travels. The subject of this course is travel narratives about Greece, and our own journey will lead us tosites throughout the country. Yet we will also be using these narratives as launchpad s for exploring the imaginary and imagined power of the Greek landscape: from its ancient status as seat of the gods to its modern appeal as a land of anonymity, relaxation and freedom for the wearied 'westerner'."
349,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,CLAS 0660. The World of Byzantium.,"Caught between the East and West, the culture of Byzantium inherited the ancient worlds of Greece, Rome, and Jerusalem, nurturing many amodern ideology, conflict, and identity. Byzantium is explored through its history, texts, and art. We examine the foundation and history of Constantinople, Iconoclasm, the Crusades, medieval Christianity and Islam, Byzantine court life, concepts of gender, self, and sexual ity."
350,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,CLAS 0750. Gender and Sexuality in Classical Antiquity.,"This course will analyze women in classical Greek and Roman society and literature. Using gender as a critical tool, we will examine Greek and Roman women in various sources, from Homeric epics and public inscriptions to scathing Roman satire. These sources show how the Greeks and Romans defined normative gender categories and how they used these categories as a vehicle for social and political criticism. Wewill cover both social history and gender discourse, focusing especially onthe body and sexual ity as a site for power. The limitations imposed by the source materials, both literary and non-literary, will be a topic of discussion throughout, as well as the relation of these ideas to contemporary constructions of gender."
351,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,CLAS 0765. Witches and Vixens: Nasty Women in Ancient Greece and Rome.,"What do video vixens and Foxy Brown have in common with Witch y Woman? These modern metaphors continue a long history of equating female sexual allure with dangers found in/or capable of subverting Nature. This course will use contemporary methodologies to make senseof similar descriptions of women found in Greco-Roman literature: how dothe Greeks and Romans express a concern about gender, ethnicity, class,and/or politics using these metaphors? How do these same categories help distinguish what is natural from unnatural? To what end does this discourse about women and nature affect law, public space, or other aspects of civilization?"
352,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,CLAS 0810A. Alexander the Great and the Alexander Tradition.,"This course focuses on a single historical figure, Alexander the Great,using him as a point of departure for exploring a wide range of problems and approaches that typify the field of Classical Studies. How knowledge of Alexander has been used and abused provides a fascinating case studyin the formation and continuous reinterpretation of the western Classical tradition."
353,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,CLAS 1120B. Epic Poetry from Homer to Lucan.,Traces the rich history and manifold varieties of the genre of epic poetry in the literatures of ancient Greece and Rome beginning with Homer'sIliad and Odyssey (VII c. B.C.) and ending with Lucan's Civil War (I. c.A.D.). Masterpieces such as Virgil's Aeneid and Ovid's Metamorphoses are included. Original sources read in translation.
354,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,CLAS 1120G. The Idea of Self.,"Literature gestures us toward a certain kind of knowledge not quite psychological, not quite philosophical. We read widely in the classical and medieval traditions in order to gauge the peculiar nature of what this knowledge tells us about experience and the ways in which expressions of self hood abide or are changed over time. Authors include but are not limited to Sappho, Pindar, Catullus, Horace, Augustine, and Fortunatus."
355,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,CLAS 1120R. Social Conflict and Political Factions in the Roman Republic.,"Traces the evolution of social conflict and political factions at Rome fromthe foundation to the dissolution of the Republic (C5-C1 BCE). Roman armies secured a vast empire of territory, raw materials, and manpower governed by the senate and the people of Rome itself. The influx of resources, however, destabilized Rome’s constitution and upset political power balances at the city of Rome. How did the Romans—elites and masses—compete amongst themselves for the bounty of empire abroad and confront their own internal conflicts at home? Was concord possible,or were the developments of empire inconsistent with the constitution ofthe Republic?"
356,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,CLAS 1120U. The American Presidents and the Western Tradition.,"We are accustomed to engaging the American presidency as a public office best approached through the prism of government or political science, but this course studies the ways in which the presidents in thought and action are part of a larger continuum of humanistic expression in the western tradition. It is organized around five categories: memory,language, consolation, farewell, and self-reflection. Our work involves reading and viewing/listening to various materials, including videos and original documents. The words we study, both by and about presidents,will be compared to various masterworks of Greco-Roman antiquity andthe western Middle Ages."
357,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,CLAS 1160. Classics of Indian Literature.,"This course will introduce, in English translations, the most powerful examples of the literature of India. The course will introduce students toIndia’s unparalleled literary richness by reading selections of the best poetry, drama, and narrative literature of Indian civilization from any ofits many languages (Sanskrit, Tamil, Hindi, Bengali, etc., and English),ancient and modern."
358,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,CLAS 1205. The Long Fall of the Roman Empire.,"Once thought of as the Dark Ages, this period of western European history should instead be seen as a fascinating time in which late Roman culture fused with that of the Germanic tribes, a mixture tempered by anew religion, Christianity. Issues of particular concern include the symbolic construction of political authority, the role of religion, the nature of social loyalties, and gender roles."
359,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,"CLAS 1210. Mediterranean Culture Wars: Archaic Greek History, c.1200 to 479 BC.","From the end of the Bronze Age to the end of the Persian Wars is a period of considerable change in the Mediterranean and beyond. The Greek polis challenges the powers of the ancient Near East. Over seven centuries wemeet Greek writing, Homeric epic, and the first historian (Herodotus). Butthe Greek world lay on the edges of the Ancient Near East and this course tries to offer a more balanced approach than the typically Helle no centric perspective of the standard textbooks. CLAS 1210 addresses political,social and economic history. Literary, epi graphical and archaeological cultures provide the evidence."
360,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,CLAS 1220. The Fall of Empires and Rise of Kings: Greek History 478to 323 BC.,"The Greek world was transformed in less than 200 years. The rise andfall of Empires (Athens and Persia) and metamorphosis of Macedon intoa supreme power under Philip II and Alexander the Great provide the headlines. The course covers an iconic period of history, and explores life-changing events that affected the people of the eastern Mediterranean and the topics that allow us to understand aspects of life and culture of the peoples of the eastern Mediterranean. and through these transformations,offers insights into the common pressures that communities confronted.No prior knowledge of ancient history is required."
361,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,"CLAS 1750P. Homicide, Revenge,  Marital Disasters: Reception ofGreek Drama in Rome, England,  Japan.","(1) We examine theater and its relation to society, particularly, its reflection of legal culture (detection s of murderers, adulterers, and young lovers);we also examine law’s ‘theatricality’ (‘productions’ of trials). (2) We also explore more broadly how dramas were performed, using as comp aranda Japanese Noh and Kabuki (in each, for example, we find all-male casting).(3) Attention is also directed toward twentieth century receptions of these plays; we focus largely on Japanese productions, particularly of Yuki oN in a gawa, mastermind of Japanese theater who directed numerous Greek tragedies and Shakespearean plays in different venues, absorbing and subverting phenomena of traditional Japanese theater."
362,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,CLAS 1750T. Love and Identity in the Roman Empire.,"Sex, pirates, powerful goddesses, and mistaken identities: these are just some of the aspects of the so-called Ancient Novel and its parodies. Inthis course we will investigate how a few fictional texts from the 1st-3 rd centuries A.D. construct their characters' gender and sexual ity, and therefore reflect concerns about wisdom, power, and difference within the Roman Empire."
363,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,CLAS 1930B. Dying God.,"The figure of the dying god (like Adonis, Osiris, or Attis), embodying both beauty and tragedy, has exerted a fascination from ancient times tothe present day. His worship was sometimes central to the community,sometimes marginal, yet compelling in its outsider status. His myths invited meditations on love and death in various modes from comedy toepic. This course, through the great mythological texts of Greece andRome as well as modern literature and art, will explore the figure in all its variety, along with Christian adaptations and recent interpretations. There will be writing assignments."

Historic al and contemporary black photo books offer densely layered accounts of blackness and black sociality that, far from restricted to the visual, are haptic and sonic engagements and improvisations. Placing these works in conversation with sonic scripts, embodied performances, and moving images inspired by and in dialogue with them, we will unpack multiple visual frequencies of black life with an eye toward understanding practices of black refusal and futurity that structure their varied creative practices. This collaborative seminar is taught in parallel by Tina Campt at Brown University and Said iy a Hartman at Columbia University."

We will look at the history of the question itself: What was the “medium” for classical antiquity and the18th-century (two historical moments on which we will focus)? How didit emerge from discussions about moderation, mediocrity, or mediation?Discussions and readings in English; students also welcome to work with texts in the originals."
1096,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,GRMN 2661U. Passive Voices.,"At the latest since Aristotle’s Peri her men ei as, there has been talk of the pathos of language: “There are symbols in the voice of the affections(pathémata) in the soul.” Those affections should be, Aristotle says, thesame for all humans, however divergent their voices. But upon these premises, the question would nonetheless arise: how might any passion be addressed or ascertained in this way, if each affect would always differ from any word that may be given of it? This course is devoted to the question of passion in language, with readings from Descartes, Spinoza,Büchner, and Musil, among others."

1202,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,HIST 1961C. Knowledge and Power: China's Examination Hell.,"For centuries a rigorous series of examinations requiring deep knowledge of the Confucian Classics was the primary tool for the selection of government officials in imperial China. This system has been variously celebrated as a tool of meritocracy and excoriated as the intellectual“straightjacket” that impeded China’s entry into the modern world. This seminar examines the system and the profound impact it had, for better or worse, on Chinese society and government in the early modern period,and the role that its successor “examination hell”—the gaokao or university entrance examination—plays in society today."

Making Revolutionary Cuba, 1959-Present.","In January 1959, the forces of rebel leader Fidel Castro entered Havana and forever altered the destiny of their nation and world. We will examine the question of political hegemony and the many silences built into the achievement of Revolution—from race to sexual ity to culture—even aswe acknowledge that popular support for that Revolution has often been both genuine and heartfelt. It is this counterpoint between the Revolution’s successes in the social, economic, and political spheres and its equally patent exclusions that have shaped Cuba’s history in the past and will continue to guide its path to an uncertain future."

1215,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,HIST 1969D. Palestine versus the Palestinians.,"This course explores alternatives to the common view that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is a struggle between two nationalist movements over thesame land. Moving away from state-centric political discourse, it engages the questions of imperialism, settler-colonialism, and displacement froma bottom-up perspective of everyday life of Palestinian communities in historic Palestine and the Diaspora. How do these internally divided and spatially fragmented communities negotiate the present and imagine the future? Ultimately, the course asks: What does it mean to be a Palestinian? And what can the Palestinian condition teach us about the modern world?"

Focused on the canonical texts of African American women, this class gestures toward diaspora as well. Moving chronologically from the history of slavery tothe present will require that we simultaneously confront the question ofwhat counts as “intellectual” history.

1222,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,HIST 1974P. Modernity's Crisis: Jewish History from the French Revolution to the Election of Donald Trump.,"As the modern world developed and grew, the question of the Jews’place within it became increasingly important for the majority societies and the Jews themselves to deal with. The solutions found have ranged from inclusion on equal terms through exclusion not only from society butfrom humanity altogether.

Examining the history of gender and family allows us to examine the limits of patriarchal control and construct a new,often surprising picture of how Jewish society actually functioned.

There are no prerequisites for this class."
1458,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,MCM 0700B. Mediating the Live: Making and DocumentingPerform ance Art.,"This course focuses on performance art and how artists use recording technologies to document their acts. We will look at key examples of performance art from the past five decades to understand how artists have explored gesture, movement, conduct, speech, embodiment.Documentation is especially important to performance because of the ephemeral nature of the art form. While the performance document isnot the same as the performance, it is central to our understanding ofthe medium and often intrinsic to the works themselves. Students will experiment with various presentation platforms and recording technologies to understand their relationship to performance art."
1459,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,MCM 0710A.

1463,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,MCM 0902M. The end of politics as we know it? New Media  PoliticalI mag in ation.,"Technical inventions have always spawned utopian visions of total social amelioration, followed closely by dystopian fears and moral panics. Digital information technologies are no different. Producing the full range of reactions—from celebrations of “networked protests” to wild accusations of“fake news”—responses to today’s media environments proclaim the endof politics as we know it. Reading works by political theorists alongside scholars of the digital, this course will question both triumphant digital utopian is m and fatalist assumptions of ubiquitous manipulation, and instead engage in more complex readings of the ways media shapes andis shaped by subjects and communities alike."
1464,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,MCM 1204J. A New Black Gaze.,"What is a ‘black gaze’? The title of this course is a provocation that poses the question of whether we can identify the existence of a black gaze,while asserting the transformative potential such a gaze both promises and portends. Starting from a close examination of theories of the gaze,we will engage the relationship between contemporary black visual it y andwhat constitutes a black gaze in the twenty-first century. Focusing on aselect group of black contemporary artists, we will explore how their work challenges traditional notions of what constitutes the power/politics of thegaze."
1465,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,MCM 1204K. From Analog to Analogue: Digital it y and Ephemeral it y in Audiovisual Archives.,"This seminar explores histories of moving image and sound archives in relation to social movements, technological change, and philosophies of cultural memory and value that dictate the content of archives and shape perceptions of their use value. We begin by exploring archives as physical entities (buildings), structures of information (catalogs, databases, finding aids) and arbiters of meaning (collections). We also consider enterprises that increasingly present themselves as archives of our contemporary selves and collective existence: Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, YouTube,Twitter. As well as exploring these issues historically and theoretically, wewill visit local archives and engage in hands on activities."
1466,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,MCM 1505B. Hitchcock: The Theory.,"The films of Hitchcock bind together compelling narratives and meta-cinematic reflections by means of a single, distinctive shape or form.this method of construction has piqued the attention not only of cinema theorists, who look to Hitchcock to tell us about the nature of cinema and spectator ship, but also philosophers, who look to him to tell us about the nature of thinking, promising, doubting, and obsession.Examining the films themselves, alongside the philosophical speculations they have inspired,we will try to define the complex pleasure -- cinematic and cerebral -- they elicit."
1467,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,"MCM 1506B. Decolonizing Museums: Restitution, Repatriation and Reparations.","Museums were part of colonial expeditions of looting and destructive extraction of objects from invaded worlds. Restitution of discrete,“precious” objects, even of dozens of thousands of them, could not bethe end of processes of repair of worlds ruined by imperial domination butits beginning. In this seminar, we will ask what would it mean to include repair and reparations in the discourse and practices of de coloni sing the museum. The publication of the Sarr-Savoy report will be our pointof departure, alongside the study of catalogues, films, photographs and muse u al practices."
1468,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,MCM 1506C. The Ethics of Psychoanalysis.,"Jacques Lacan’s seminar VII: The Ethics of Psychoanalysis examines theories of ethics, from Aristotle through Bentham and Kant, before proposing an ethics proper to psychoanalysis. The seminar concludes witha fascinating analysis of Sophocles’ Antigone. We will read the seminar closely alongside texts by Freud, Lacan, Badiou, and other contemporary thinkers. Why does psychoanalysis bother to enter ethical debates rather than reject the category altogether?"
1469,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,MCM 1506E. Rethinking Black Visual it y.,"As part of the Cogut Humanities Center‘s Black Visual i ties Initiative,this course will engage practices and theories of black visual it y that refuse traditional definitions of visual it y that function to refuse blackness itself. Each year, the seminar will focus on a selected genre of visual texts, artistic works, and/or embodied performances and use them to develop an keen understanding of how black artists/thinkers/writers/practitioners articulate the multi-sensory frequencies of black life. Key toour discussions is a rigorous the or iz ation of the complex practices of black refusal and futurity that structure these works."
1470,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,MCM 1700D. Re framing Documentary Production: Concepts and Questions.,"An advanced seminar for students of video and/or film production.Focuses on the critical discussion and production of documentary media.A major project (10-20 minutes), three shorter works, and in-class presentations of work-in-progress required.

Students must bring a completed application to the first class to be considered for admission."
1471,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,MCM 1701E. Experimental Narrative.,"With film well into its 2nd century, a large body of work has emerged that plays with, around, and against conventions of classical cinema.Specifically, what we understand to be traditional narrative structures,such as drama, documentary, and action films. In fact, experimental narrative now has some of its own genres, which are to be found in both mainstream and fringe media. The goal of this class is to investigate some of these forms of experimental narrative. It is predicated on a basic understanding of narrative conventions, and designed to encourage students to make work that challenges those conventions."
1472,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,MCM 1701G. Text in Time-based Art.,"Semiotics has taught us to regard each film as a text. What, then, is therole of written text in film? This advanced production seminar explores the interplay of film’s desire to image language and language’s desire to produce images, not to mention the temporal constraints placed on reading when it is no longer a private, self-regulated activity. Wewill consider text as a purely visual character, the impact of subtitles,television’s gluttonous use of text, and film’s appropriation of literary forms.In addition to screenings and readings, students will create their own instantiations of written language in time-based art."
1473,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,"MCM 1701I. Digital World ing: Terraforming Future, Fact, Fiction and F abul ation.","Inspired by Marilyn St rather n’s concept of ‘world ing,’ this production course, will speculate on technologies of the future as a way to address the present. We’ll work in the game designing platform, Unity, Adobe Premiere, and Photoshop to fabricate and co-create our worlds. Although not a gaming course, tools, theories, and vernaculars of game design maybe utilized/subverted. Expect readings, discussions, technical workshops,and weekly assignments leading to a final project. “Art in the biological,ecological, and cyborg modes are all aspects of world ing. We cannot denounce the world in the name of an ideal world” - Donna Haraway"

1477,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,"MCM 2100X. What is Reality, Now?.",The question of reality has emerged recently with renewed force and sporting a speculative edge. Philosophers are abandoning their hostility to science without going so far as to embrace vulgar material ism. How are these gyrations of thought held together? What are the stakes of this newline of inquiry for the human subject? For esthetics? For politics?
1478,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,MCM 2110T. The Contingency of Critique.,"Contemporary debates about the nature and status, affects and effects, of critique resonate across the disciplines and beyond. They raise questions of reading and form, ontology and determination, subjectivity and politics.This course takes the notion of surprise as one of the more consistently cited values of the post-critical turn. On this view, critique is the enemy of surprise. Suspicious, dogmatic, grimly predictable: it is incapable of and hostile towards surprise.

1929,BrownSUPERTRIMMED_spaced,SOC 1311. Micro-Organizational Theory: Social Behavior in Organizations.,"Micro-Organizational Theory focuses on the human dynamics of organizations as natural systems. It examines how in divi dual attitudes,actions, and interactions make a difference for organizational processes and outcomes. This focus is contrasted with more macro-level approaches, which take the organization (instead of the in divi dual) as the primary unit of analysis.
