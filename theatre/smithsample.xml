<P>SDS 107 Statistical Thinking </P> 

<P>Formaly known as  MTH 107 An introduction to statistics that teaches broadly relevant concepts. Students from all disciplines are welcome. Topics include graphical and numerical methods for summarizing data; binomial and normal probability distributions; point and interval estimates for means and for proportions; one- and two-sample tests for means and for proportions; principles of experimental design. The class meets in a computer lab and emphasizes using the computer for analysis of data. Students design experiments, collect and analyze the data, and write reports on findings. Enrollment limited to 25. Prerequisite: high school algebra. {M} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>SDS 136 Communicating with Data </P>

<P>The world is growing increasingly reliant on collecting and analyzing information to help people make decisions. Because of this, the ability to communicate effectively about data is an important component of future job prospects across nearly all disciplines. In this course, students learn the foundations of information visualization and sharpen their skills in communicating using data. Throughout the semester, we explore concepts in decision-making, human perception, color theory and storytelling as they apply to data-driven communication. Whether youâ€™re an aspiring data scientist or you just want to learn new ways of presenting information, this course helps you build a strong foundation in how to talk to people about data. (E) {M} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>SDS 192 Introduction to Data Science </P>

<P>An introduction to data science using Python, R and SQL. Students learn how to scrape, process and clean data from the web; manipulate data in a variety of formats; contextualize variation in data; construct point and interval estimates using resampling techniques; visualize multidimensional data; design accurate, clear and appropriate data graphics; create data maps and perform basic spatial analysis; and query large relational databases. No prerequisites, but a willingness to write code is necessary. Enrollment limit of 30. (E) {M} Credits: 4 </P>

<Sect>
<P>SDS 201 Statistical Methods for Undergraduates </P>

<P>(Formerly MTH/PSY 201 and MTH/PSY 190). An overview of the statistical methods needed for undergraduate research emphasizing methods for data collection, data description and statistical inference including an introduction to study design, confidence intervals, testing hypotheses, analysis of variance and regression analysis. Techniques for analyzing both quantitative and categorical data are discussed. Applications are emphasized, and students use R for data analysis. Classes meet for lecture/discussion and a required laboratory that emphasizes the analysis of real data. This course satisfies the basic requirement for the psychology major. Students who have taken MTH 111 or the equivalent should take MTH 220, which also satisfies the basic requirement. Normally students receive credit for only one of the following introductory statistics courses: MTH 201/PSY 201; ECO 220, GOV 190, MTH 219, MTH 220 or SOC 201. </P>

<P>{M} Credits: 5 </P>

<P>SDS 220 Introduction to Probability and Statistics </P>

<P>Similar to MTH An application-oriented introduction to modern statistical inference: study design, descriptive statistics; random variables; probability and sampling distributions; point and interval estimates; hypothesis tests, resampling procedures and multiple regression. A wide variety of applications from the natural and social sciences are used. Classes meet for lecture/discussion and for a required laboratory that emphasizes analysis of real data. MTH 220 satisfies the basic requirement for biological science, engineering, environmental science, neuroscience and psychology. Normally students receive credit for only one of the following introductory statistics courses: MTH 201/ PSY 201, GOV 190, ECO 220, MTH 219, MTH 220 or SOC 201. Exceptions may be allowed in special circumstances and require the permission of the adviser and the instructor. Prerequisite: MTH 111 or the equivalent, or permission of the instructor. Lab sections limited to 20. {M} Credits: 5 </P>
