<P>EGR 100 Engineering for Everyone </P>

<P>EGR 100 serves as an accessible course for all students, regardless of background or intent to major in engineering. Students develop a sound understanding of the engineering design process, including problem definition, background research, identification of design criteria, development of metrics and methods for evaluating alternative designs, prototype development, and proof of concept testing. Working in teams, students present their ideas through oral and written reports. Reading assignments and in-class discussions challenge students to critically analyze contemporary issues related to the interaction of technology and society. Organized around different themes, multiple sections. Engineering majors are required to take this course. Those students considering majoring in engineering are strongly encouraged to take EGR 100 during their first year. Enrollment limit of 20. Credits: 4 How We Engineer the Environment We will search, query, examine, discuss, debate (agree and disagree)—and through the process, learn about the pressing issues related engineering and our environment. We will grapple with the urgent, pressing and complex challenges and potential engineering solutions for the sustainable stewardship of our environment. {N} </P>

<P>EGR 110 Fundamental Engineering Principles </P>

<P>The design and analysis of engineered or natural systems and processes relies on a command of fundamental scientific and engineering principles. This course provides an introduction to these fundamental underpinnings through a study of the conservation of mass, energy and charge in both steady and transient conditions with non-reactive systems. Specific topics covered include a review of process variables and their relationships, open and closed systems, differential and integral balances, and basic thermodynamics. Corequisite: MTH 112. Enrollment limit of 20. Credits: 4 </P>

<P>Core Courses </P>

<P>All Engineering core courses are restricted by permission of the program. All of these courses are required for the major in Engineering Science (EGR). All but fluid mechanics are required for the major in Engineering Arts (EGN). </P>

<P>EGR 220 Engineering Circuit Theory </P>

<P>Analog and digital circuits are the building blocks of computers, medical technologies, and all things electrical. This course introduces both the fundamental principles necessary to understand how circuits work and mathematical tools that have widespread applications in areas throughout engineering and science. Topics include, Kirchhoff’s laws, Thévenin and Norton equivalents, superposition, responses of first-order and second-order networks, time-domain and frequency-domain analyses, and frequency-selective networks. Required laboratory taken once a week. Corequisites: PHY 210, Engineering requires Calculus III. Enrollment limit of 20. {N} Credits: 5 </P>

<P>Judith B. Cardell, Susan Elizabeth Voss </P>

<P>Normally offered both fall and spring semesters </P>

<P>EGR 270 Engineering Mechanics </P>

<P>This course introduces the basic theoretical concepts, procedures and methodologies needed to understand the mechanical behavior of objects in static equilibrium. Topics to be covered include 2d and 3d particle and rigid body equilibrium; analysis of frames, trusses, beams and machines; centroids; distributed loading; moment of inertia; internal forces and moments; and an introduction to stress and strain. In addition to developing competence in applying standard problem-solving procedures, students will also apply their understanding in real world contexts. Prerequisites: PHY 117 and MTH 112 (or the equivalent). Required laboratory taken once a week. Enrollment limit of 20. </P>

<P>EGR 290 Engineering Thermodynamics </P>

<P>Modern civilization relies profoundly on efficient production, management and consumption of energy. Thermodynamics is the science of energy transformations involving work, heat and the properties of matter. Engineers rely on thermodynamics to assess the feasibility of their designs in a wide variety of fields including chemical processing, pollution control and abatement, power generation, materials science, engine design, construction, refrigeration and microchip processing. Course topics include first and second laws of thermodynamics, power cycles; combustion and refrigeration; phase equilibria; ideal and nonideal mixtures, conductive, convective and radiative heat transfer. Prerequisite EGR 110, CHM 111 or 118; corequisite MTH 212. Enrollment limit of 20. {N} Credits: 4 </P>

<P>EGR 374 Fluid Mechanics </P>

<P>This is the second course in a two-semester sequence designed to introduce students to fundamental theoretical principles and analysis of mechanics of continuous media, including solids and fluids. Concepts and topics to be covered in this course include intensive and extensive thermophysical properties of fluids; control-volume and differential expressions for conservation of mass, momentum and energy; dimensional analysis; and an introduction to additional topics such as aerodynamics, open-channel flow, and the use of fluid mechanics in the design process. Required concurrent laboratory. Prerequisites: EGR 270 and MTH 212. Enrollment limit of 20. {N} Credits: 0–5 </P>
