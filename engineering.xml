<P>To adequately address the challenges facing society in the 21st century, there is a critical need for broadly educated engineers who can demonstrate adaptability to rapidly changing technologies and to increasingly complex multinational markets. Engineers must have the understanding needed to address the cultural, political, and economic realities of our times, along with the technical depth to appropriately frame complex problems using ethical reasoning. The preparation for such a path is argued to be effectively achieved in a liberal arts setting. </P>

<P>At Smith, the engineering degrees offered are based on rigorous plans of study integrated with the liberal arts and sciences. There are two possible paths for the study of engineering at Smith College. The first is the ABET-accredited bachelor of science (S.B.) in engineering science, and the second is the bachelor of arts (A.B.) in engineering arts. More detailed information about both degree options can be found below. </P>

<P>The Picker Engineering Program’s educational objectives are to produce graduates who, within a few years of graduation, will: </P>

<L>

<H1>The Majors </H1>

<P>Engineering Arts, Bachelor of Arts </P>

<P>Advisers: Members of the Picker Engineering Program </P>

<P>The Purpose of the Major. The bachelor of arts in engineering arts is offered for those students who recognize the increasing importance of engineering and design in today’s world, who want to better understand the engineer’s role in service to humanity, and who do not intend to pursue professional practice as engineers. The bachelor of arts is not an ABET-accredited degree. </P>
</Sect>

<P>The Importance of the Liberal Arts. The possibilities of coupling the bachelor of arts in engineering arts with other disciplines are boundless. The bachelor of arts coupled with a focused set of studies in the liberal arts is a particularly well-suited course of study for preparing students to address the complexities of the world in which we live. </P>

<P>Engineering Science, Bachelor of Science </P>

<P>Advisers: Members of the Picker Engineering Program </P>

<P>Smith offers an undergraduate curriculum leading to an ABET-accredited degree in engineering science, the broad study of the foundational scientific and engineering principles that govern the practice of all engineering disciplines. The bachelor of science degree program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org. The American Society for Engineering Education, identifying the critical need for broadly educated engineers, points out that the design of an engineering curriculum should “recognize the pitfalls of overspecialization in the face of an increasing demand for graduates who can demonstrate adaptability to rapidly changing technologies and to increasingly complex multinational markets.” An integral component of the program is the continuous emphasis on the use of engineering science principles in design. This culminates in a final capstone design project that incorporates broad-based societal aspects. Students are encouraged to pursue a corporate and/or research internship to complement their classroom instruction. Engineers must be able to communicate effectively and work in team settings. Smith’s highly-regarded writing intensive first-year curriculum ensures that engineering students begin their engineering curriculum with appropriate communication skills that will be refined during the remainder of their studies. Every engineering course offered at Smith incorporates elements of teamwork and oral/written communication. </P>
